        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Arielle Haryanto, a dedicated and excited full time student at University of Riverside. Here at Riverside, I am a Pre-Business major, with a possibility of concentration in Information Systems. I would characterize myself as a student and employee that has unwavering determination and always wants to learn more.<br><br>

        Beyond school, I have experience within the work industry where I was able to learn important skills and experiences that help me with my academic pursuits. At my first job, I was able to code for a small business, Kathyâ€™s Cafe. It was an experience to be able to interact with a client that has their requests. With this job, I was able to adjust certain things to be able to make the website to what she needed as well as keeping her desires reasonable. There are obviously portions of my coding that I have improved on since then and have learned so much about creating a website for a business as well as how it will be the most beneficial for the customers and producers. Working as a coder, not only expanded my coding skills, but also with understanding the market of what people on the web are attracted more towards and how certain colors and images pull customers in more. This combined my knowledge of psychology and coding into one. This was not the only job that I had learned immensely from. For example, I used to work at ColdStone Creamery, where I recognized the importance of teamwork. There are many tasks to do throughout the day, which can seem overwhelming, however, with everyone working together and helping each other when needed, things are able to be finished quickly and efficiently. My ability to work collaboratively with my team improved my interpersonal and communication skills that I lacked previously. <br><br>

        Now I am a part of the marketing committee at Design@UCR. This is the first time at University of Riverside that we are having a Designathon, an amazing experience for anyone interested in coding, UI/UX, marketing, art, etc. It has so far been an incredible learning experience, especially working with older members that have had more experience within the field. Having a mentor that guides us through how the items and flyers we create and be shaped, grouped, organized, colored differently creates an immense difference in how the viewers will see the experience. I have learned so much from these mentors and still have much to learn. Everyone is welcoming and is ready to learn more. Working together is the most important characteristic within a team/ committee, in order for us to meet deadlines as well as have a product that everyone is proud of. In the future, I want to continue my education and experience within the business world. I have a passion for UI/UX design due to my prior experience coding and design for others. However, I am open to learning more about different parts within this field. Whether it be about marketing, sales, communications, management, etc. Overall I am willing to put in the work and seize the opportunity.
